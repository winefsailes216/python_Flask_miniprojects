1.) **Employee Management App with Authentication**
I used .txtfiles to store data of users and employees since I haven't had database here yet. I wanted to incorporate and practice file handling.
Then I added basic Authentication with Flask_login, requests, render_template, and url_for, it worked well but I haven't added the styles CSS yet.

2.) **Weather App(v2) Public API from OpenWeather**
From all of my projects in Flask I used HTML/CSS for pages and styling.
And in this app I successfully used the API from OpenWeather which was really awesome. 
The Data there are dynamic, I was amazed! How much more if this is a real project with real weather data.

 
3.) **To-do List (v2)**
This To-do List is an extension or upgrade of my previous project which was run in the terminal.
This time I was able to run the exact same code in Flask with HTML and the same .txt file for storage of data.
I added render html template, requests, url_for, redirect for html manipulation and basic routing.

4.) **Weather App (v1) with mock API**
This is a weather app using Flask and basic mock api that I built with dictionaries as sample data
And I created an index.html for the post form. Whether the city entered in the Label is found or not 
in the mock Data, it will go to result.html to show the result.


You will need python and Flask and it's depedencies installed from your device to run the app.
